# TINDEV
Project developed using nodejs, reactjs and react-native. This project is similar to the famous dating app tinder, however, in this one the user look for developers.

##

*[git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) *this link is for windows*

##Getting Started

Create or choose a folder where you gonna clone the project
Clone the repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/djanlm/SemanaOmniStack8_TINDEV.git`

To run the backend, go to the backend folder and run the command `yarn dev`. It will run on port 3333.
In this project we used mongoDB to store our data. We created a server and a database on (mongoDB atlas)[https://account.mongodb.com/account/login]. 
If you cannot connect to the database you might have to create and configure your own.


To run the frontend part developed for web using reactJS, go to the frontend folder and run `yarn start`

To be able to run the app for cellphone, you'll need an emulator. I'd recommend android studio emulator. As mentioned before you might follow the react-native [getting started tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.61/getting-started).
Once you have your emulator running, run the command `npx react-native run-android`
